## Project description

### Development choices

#### I created a small Vue app with a Node.js-based, Express backend. Since the commissioned project mentioned JSON in the requirements, I coded a minimal reproduction of a potentially larger use case in which I retrieve data stored in a JSON from an API call with Axios. I use Vuex store as a single point of truth in our statistical data, which is reactive. In Vuex, I use persistence as a technique to minimize API calls from the same device on page creation. I use GSAP's TweenMax to implement targeted State Transitions on layout change. I use Jest for testing purposes.
